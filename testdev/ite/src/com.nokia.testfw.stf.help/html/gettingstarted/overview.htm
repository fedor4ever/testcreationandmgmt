<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>STF is an advanced test harness for testing Symbian and S60 non-UI components. It is a toolkit designed for test case implementation and test cases execution.</p>
<p>STF provides a framework for implementing test cases in separate test classes, meaning that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>test cases are implemented to separate test classes. </li>
	<li>test class implement a common test class API.</li>
	<li>test classes run independently in their own threads. </li>
</ul>
<p>STF is not an automatic test case creator, but it does enable you to concentrate on the actual test case implementation.</p>
<p>The benefit of STF is to: &ldquo;write once, test everywhere&rdquo;. This means, for example, that test cases made during the development phase can be used in system testing, automatic release testing, and so on.</p>
<p>The ITE Carbide plug-in lets you easily create STF test classes and test cases, as well as configure some of STF's options.</p>

<h3>ATS TestDrop</h3>
<p>STF also contains TestDrop functionality that lets you create test packages of STF projects and send them to the Automatic Test System (ATS) for execution. For more information, see <a href="../concepts/ats.htm">Automatic Test System (ATS)</a>.</p>
